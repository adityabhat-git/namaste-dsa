/**
 * Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,0,1]

Output: 2

Explanation:

n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1]

Output: 2

Explanation:

n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]

Output: 8

Explanation:

n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 * Solution: One Pass
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
 * We can use the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers, which is n*(n+1)/2.
 * We calculate this sum for n, where n is the length of the input array.
 * Then we subtract the sum of the numbers in the input array from this calculated sum.
 * The result will be the missing number.

var missingNumber = function (nums) {
    const n = nums.length; // Get the length of the input array
    const expectedSum = (n * (n + 1)) / 2; // Calculate the expected sum of numbers from 0 to n
    const actualSum = nums.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0); // Calculate the actual sum of numbers in the input array
    return expectedSum - actualSum; // The difference will be the missing number
};

// Example usage:
const nums1 = [3, 0, 1];
console.log(missingNumber(nums1)); // Output: 2
const nums2 = [0, 1];
console.log(missingNumber(nums2)); // Output: 2
const nums3 = [9, 6, 4, 2, 3, 5, 7, 0, 1];
console.log(missingNumber(nums3)); // Output: 8
